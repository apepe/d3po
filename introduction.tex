This week we are launching a brand new look for Authorea and a couple of exciting new features aimed at making science more interactive. Since the very beginning of Authorea, we have been striving to make collaborative scientific writing as easy as possible. But in addition to \textbf{writing}, we also want to create space for new ways of \textbf{reading} science, and \textbf{executing} it.
