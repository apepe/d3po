\section{What next?}

Interested in providing your readers with a more interactive view of your research? Want to share your data and analysis with your coauthors, peers, colleagues (or the public)? These tools are for you! Go ahead and start creating your own interactive and executable visualization.

We will be publishing more examples and tutorials on how to use Javascript, IPython (and other tools!) to create beautiful interactive plots. If you want to get started sooner than that, feel free to experiment on your own or get in touch with any question you may have at \textbf{hi@authorea.com}.
