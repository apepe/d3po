\section{Stellar Structure}
An isobar with volume $\VP$ and surface area $\SP$ deviates from spherical symmetry in the presence of rotation.
However one can retain a 1D approximation by re-defining the radius coordinate
as the radius of a sphere  containing the same volume $\VP=4\pi \rP^3/3$, which allows to re-write the equation 
of continuity in the usual form
